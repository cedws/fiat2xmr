# fiat2xmr
Due to regulations, Monero can't be bought directly on cryptocurrency exchanges in the UK. It's trivial however to buy another currency and exchange it for XMR. This tool uses [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) and [SideShift](https://sideshift.ai) to automatically convert fiat into XMR. All you need to do is deposit fiat into your Coinbase account. Fees are minimised by using the advanced order API and should be typically less than 1%.

You should not use this tool unless you are comfortable with using Coinbase and SideShift. Ensure your API keys are properly protected. I take no responsibility for any issues you may encounter.
