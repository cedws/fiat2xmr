Due to some fucking UK regulations it is not possible to buy one of the only private cryptocurrencies, Monero, on exchanges directly. It is however possible to purchase other currencies and convert them to Monero using services such as [SideShift](https://sideshift.ai). This tool aims to automate the process making it a single step to turn fiat in your Coinbase account into Monero deposited into your wallet. It should also highlight how utterly fucking stupid UK regulations can be.

Work in progress.
